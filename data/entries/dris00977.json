	"description": "OMEGA-PSIR@WUT is the fully functional CRIS operated at the Warsaw University of Technology (WUT). It provides the University Management with a complete view of research achievements of the University, and reports the achievements to the national authorities. It also functions as Institutional Repository, making it possible to archive full-texts, and provides access directly to the users. It is compliant with the OAI-PMH protocol. The system grants end-users access to the files according to the copyright permissions and the users\u2019 privileges. For example, for an authorized user a publication can be provided directly from the system, otherwise the system directs the user to the publisher site.<br />The Knowledge Base stores all data referring to the scientific activities of researchers: publications, scientific reports, supervised theses, project documents, but also descriptions of project results (prototypes, technologies, software, data, etc). Whenever needed, the ontology can be extended. All the objects are semantically linked to each other, building a knowledge-rich semantic network.<br />The system provides mechanisms for searching for domain experts and teams. The search for experts is based on the collected researchers achievements (publications, projects), which are measured according to predefined metrics. A complete and comprehensive information stored in the knowledge base makes it possible to build automatically professional profiles of the researchers. Each scientist can use his/her profile for generating a CV. By aggregating profiles of all employees of a given unit the system produces and visualizes a profile of the unit.<br />The research assessment algorithms for individual researchers or for a whole unit can be defined according to specific needs. Many algorithms can be defined within the system. These algorithms can be prepared as a script, so there is no need to reprogram the system if the evaluation criteria change. With the specified algorithms the system automatically evaluates the scores of the research achievements. The algorithms can take into account journal impact factor, number of citations, etc.<br />The system has various predefined reports. The researchers can find reports needed for a promotion or yearly evaluation, the faculty managers and deans can produce research activity reports for a given period for a person, a team or a unit. One can also generate a bibliometric analysis. If available, the system can use citations by WoS or Scopus. In addition, the system provides easy ways to define quite advanced report templates, which then can be used by the end-users. All reports can be generated in HTML, Winword or PDF.<br />Bearing in mind the quality of data, and their importance in various evaluation procedures, the system uses versioning of records. It is therefore possible to know what kind of changes have been made, and by whom. <br />The system is flexible and can be adapted to various needs. Whenever changes in metadata structure are needed, the system ontology can easily be extended with the inclusion of new objects and/or attributes. There is no need for programming the changes in the system. Instead of this, and based on the XML description of new objects/attributes, the system will automatically adapt the database structure and will prepare the data entry forms, and the search forms. It is possible to define the structure of the University according to the specific needs, taking into account sub-units of the required sub-level (faculties, institutes, divisions, teams, etc). Whenever the hierarchical structure of the University changes, the system takes into account the possibility of splitting a unit, or joining some units into one, or just changing the name of a unit. With the possibilities to define roles and their privileges the system can map any structure to organize the work of various groups of participants, reflecting the specific roles of particular units and people at the University.<br />Every sub-unit of the University, i.e. faculty, division, institute, etc., may wish to present its research achievements on the sub-unit page. And the system makes it possible, so that one can present the sub-units achievements in a personalized graphical layout directly on the sub-unit home page.<br />In order to efficiently perform business processes the system allows an easy integration with various in-house systems. Thanks to the API REST and OAI-PMH features, OMEGA-PSIR@WUT can be integrated with almost any contemporary internal or external system.",
