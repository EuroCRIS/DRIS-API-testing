	"description": "u:cris is the central database for research output, activities and projects at the University of Vienna. It aims to provide a tool for reporting on performance indicators, as well as to promote research at the University of Vienna to the public. Until 2013 the university used for this purpose an in-house developed system. In 2013 a vendor system was adopted as replacement.  u:cris is currently in its final stages of implementation. The next major task will be the integration of u:cris with the institutional repository u:scholar and the university's digital asset management system PHAIDRA",
